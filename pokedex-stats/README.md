## Stats on the Pok√©dex Screen

Originally by [DoesntKnowHowToPlay](https://www.pokecommunity.com/member.php?u=300067) and later improved by [Squeetz](https://www.pokecommunity.com/member.php?u=400825) and [Spherical Ice](https://www.pokecommunity.com/member.php?u=67281), this hack [replaces the weight comparison in the Pokedex with that Pokemon's base stats and possible abilities](https://www.pokecommunity.com/showpost.php?p=9878890&postcount=1357).

### Installation

Nothing unusual here. Aside from the filenames of your ROM and where you want the code to be inserted, there's nothing to configure. And then just run `/path/to/armips pokedex-stats/main.asm`.
