## Player Turns to Face Trainers

In RBY, when you get challenged by an NPC trainer, you don't turn to look at them. GSC fixed this, and every game since has done the same, with the exception of Fire Red and Leaf Green, which removed the feature to be more like RBY. Luckily, [Jambo51](https://www.pokecommunity.com/member.php?u=156050) managed to [fix it](http://www.romhack.me/tutorials/view/having-the-player-face-trainers-in-firered/).

### Installation

Nothing unusual here. Aside from the filenames of your ROM and where you want the code to be inserted, there's nothing to configure. And then just run `/path/to/armips trainer-face.asm`.
